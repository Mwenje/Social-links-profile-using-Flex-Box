### What I learned

inline elements (like a normal <span>) stay within the text flow, don’t create new lines, and only accept basic styling—no controllable width/height and limited vertical spacing. Ideal for simple text formatting.

inline-block also stays on the same line but gives you full control over padding, margins, borders, background, width, and height. It’s the go-to for styling small text fragments that need a bit more design without breaking the line.

block elements create a new line and take full width by default, making them suitable for large structural elements—not for small text styling.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
